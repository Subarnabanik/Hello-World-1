#The relationship between two variables is generally considered strong when their r value is larger than 0.7. The correlation r measures the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.Positive correlation exists when two variables move in the same direction.Negative Correlation: as one variable increases, the other decreases.Correlation coefficients whose magnitude are between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate variables which can be considered moderately correlated. Correlation coefficients whose magnitude are between 0.3 and 0.5 indicate variables which have a low correlation.

# Based on the Summary of patient_df explanationations are below:
# There is no symmetric Histogram which shows mean and median are approximately equal.
# hist(patient_df$Clean_Full);The histogram shows the facility was clean is skewed left and here the mean is less than the median. This is the case because skewed-left data have a few small values that drive the mean value 96.73 is smaller than medial value 97.
# hist(patient_df$Clean_Simi);The histogram is skewed right; the mean is greater than the median. A right-skewed distribution has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. Here the Mean is 3.078 which is greater than the Median 3. Similarly, other Histograms can be described.
